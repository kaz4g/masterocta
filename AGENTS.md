# Codex Working Agreement

## Product direction

Masta-Octa is a public, non-commercial GPL-3.0 fork of the upstream Octatrack
Manager project. The goal is to build a safe macOS-first Octatrack MkII library
and project manager. Preserve compatibility with upstream Octatrack project
files and keep upstream changes easy to review and merge.

User-facing display name is **Masta-Octa**. Internal compatibility IDs remain
**masterocta** / **MasterOCTa** (repo, npm/Cargo package, bundle identifier,
Application Support directory, schemas, journals, backup IDs).

Read `docs/CODEX_HANDOFF.md` before planning or implementing work.
For new architecture, API boundaries, data ownership, and migration order, also
read `docs/NEXT_GENERATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`. New code must not bypass its
Intent -> Plan -> Apply write boundary.

## Non-negotiable data-safety rules

- Treat mounted Octatrack media as irreplaceable user data.
- Default to read-only discovery and inspection.
- Never test destructive operations against original removable media. Use a
  copied card image, a temporary fixture, or an explicit test directory.
- Before a write, verify that the target is inside a user-approved Octatrack
  root and reject traversal, symlink escape, and malformed names.
- Prefer atomic replacement, automatic backups, and recoverable trash over
  permanent deletion.
- A failed or cancelled operation must leave the original data unchanged.
- Do not add cloud synchronization until the local path boundary and backup
  model are implemented and tested.

## Security and supply-chain rules

- Keep the upstream auto-updater disabled until the fork has its own release
  endpoint and signing key.
- Enable a restrictive Tauri CSP and grant the frontend only the permissions it
  actually needs.
- Pin Git dependencies to immutable revisions and GitHub Actions to full commit
  SHAs.
- Use lockfiles and reproducible install commands (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`,
  `cargo --locked`).
- Do not introduce binary blobs, install-time shell downloads, telemetry, or
  new network endpoints without an explicit review.
- Run `pnpm audit` and `cargo audit` when dependencies change. Document accepted
  risk instead of silently ignoring advisories.

## Change discipline

- Keep security hardening separate from product features.
- Make small, reviewable commits and preserve upstream attribution.
- Do not rewrite upstream history.
- Add regression tests for every parser, filesystem, rename, delete, move,
  backup, conversion, and slice-metadata change.
- Preserve unrelated user changes in the worktree.

## Minimum verification

Run the relevant subset for each change, and run the full available suite before
handoff:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test:frontend
pnpm run build
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --all -- --check
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cd src-tauri && cargo test --workspace
```

Rust/Tauri verification may require macOS or Linux GTK/WebKit system packages.
If the environment blocks a command, report the exact environmental blocker and
do not present the unrun check as passing.

## Project skills

Repository-specific Codex skills live under `.agents/skills/`. Read the matching
skill before work covered by its description. Skills do not expand user
authorization or override the hard safety boundaries in this file, the
architecture guard, or CI. Do not modify the user-level skill that prohibits
mutations against the upstream repository.
