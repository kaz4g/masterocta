# Quick Start

This guide will get you up and running with Masta-Octa in just a few minutes.

## 1. Scan for Projects

When you first open Masta-Octa, your first task is to find your work.

Click **Scan for Projects** to let the app automatically search for:

- **Removable Drives:** Mounted CompactFlash cards and USB drives.
- **Common Paths:** Folders like `Documents`, `Music`, `Downloads`, and `Desktop`.
- **Octatrack Folders:** Any folder on your home directory named `octatrack`, `Octatrack`, or `OCTATRACK`.

If your projects are in a custom location which is not automatically detected (e.g., an external drive or a specific backup folder), click **Browse...** to select it manually.

## 2. Navigate Your Content

Found content is grouped into **Locations** (where your Sets are located) and **Individual Projects** (not part of a Set).

- **Locations:** Each card represents a Set on your disk or CF card. It shows the number of projects inside and if it has a valid Audio Pool.
- **Open a Project:** Click on any project name to enter the **Project Detail** view.
- **Access the Audio Pool of a Set:** Click the **Audio Pool** card within a Set to manage your samples.

## 3. Explore Project Details

Once a project is open, you can see everything about it.

The **Overview** tab shows your mixer, MIDI, memory, and metronome settings. This is a view that helps you understand how the project was configured when last saved.

![Project detail — Overview](/img/screenshots/project-details.png)

### Switching Between Tabs

At the top of the project view, you can switch between several specialized views:

- **Parts:** Manage the 4 sound snapshots (kits) for each bank.
- **Patterns:** Visualize your sequences and triggers in detail.
- **Flex / Static:** Browse, search, filter sample slots and [assign samples](../features/sample-slots.md#assigning--managing-samples) to them from the Audio Pool or your computer.
- **Tools:** Access bulk copy operations between projects.

## 4. Edit a Part

To modify a part, navigate to the **Parts** tab and select a bank (A–P).

1. Select a specific **Bank** and one of the 4 **Parts** (Part 1, 2, 3, or 4).
2. Toggle **Edit mode** using the switch in the top header.
3. Use the knobs and fields to modify machine parameters, effects, and LFOs.
4. Each change is **written to project immediately** as you make it, in the form of 'un-saved' changes - Just like on the Octatrack.
5. Changes can then be saved to the current Part, All Parts, or reverted (reloads to 'saved' state of Part).

## 5. Manage Your Audio Pool

In the **Audio Pool** view, you can move samples from your computer into your Set.

1. Browse your computer in the left panel and your Audio Pool in the right panel.
2. Select the audio files you want to add.
3. Click **Copy to Pool**.
4. Masta-Octa will **automatically convert them** as needed - making all audio files compatible with the Octatrack by default (Format, Sampling Rate, Bit Depth).

## 6. Manage Sample Slots

On the **Flex** and **Static** tabs you can assign samples to your project's 256 slots - no hardware needed. Slot editing requires **Edit mode** (toggle in the header, or press <kbd>E</kbd>).

1. Open the project's **Flex** or **Static** tab and switch to **Edit mode**.
2. Open the **Audio Pool pane** (toggle in the toolbar, or press <kbd>A</kbd>) to browse the Set's samples right beside the slots.
3. **Drag** one or more samples - from the pane or directly from your computer - onto a slot row. Multiple files (or a whole folder) fill consecutive empty slots. Files dragged from your computer are imported and converted automatically.
4. Alternatively, right-click a pool sample to **Assign to first empty slot** / **Assign to selected slot**, or right-click a slot to **import** files from disk.
5. Right-click any slot to **clear** its sample or **reset** its attributes; selecting multiple slots applies the action to all of them.

See [Assigning & Managing Samples](../features/sample-slots.md#assigning--managing-samples) for the full details.

## 7. Copy Content Within and Between Projects

The **Tools** tab lets you copy content between banks and projects without touching the hardware. Select an operation from the dropdown, configure source, options, and destination, then execute.

![Tools - Copy](/img/screenshots/tools-copy-bank.png)

Available Operations:

- **[Copy Banks](../features/copy-bank.md):** Copy an entire bank (all 4 Parts + 16 Patterns) with optional sample slot transfer and automatic remapping.
- **[Copy Parts](../features/copy-parts.md):** Transfer Part sound design (machines, amps, LFOs, FX) between parts and banks.
- **[Copy Patterns](../features/copy-patterns.md):** Copy patterns with configurable Part assignment and track scope.
- **[Copy Tracks](../features/copy-tracks.md):** Copy individual track data — sound design, pattern triggers, or both.
- **[Copy Sample Slots](../features/copy-sample-slots.md):** Copy sample slot assignments with optional audio file transfer and Audio Pool management.

All operations work within the same project or across different projects.

The destination project can be selected from your scanned locations or browsed manually:

:::tip
Your copy settings (selected operation, destination project, slot ranges, etc.) are remembered for each project during your session — you can switch tabs and come back without losing selected values.
:::

## 8. Fix Missing Samples

The **Tools** tab also includes a **[Fix Missing Samples](../features/fix-missing-samples.md)** operation that scans your project for broken sample slot references and automatically locates and reconnects missing audio files.

It searches the project directory, Audio Pool, and sibling projects, with the option to browse additional directories manually.

## 9. Fix Incompatible Samples

The Tools tab includes a **[Fix Incompatible Samples](../features/fix-incompatible-samples.md)** operation which will bulk fix any incompatible audio files the Octatrack can't read (wrong sample rate, wrong bit depth, or a format like MP3).

This can be done from either:
- **Fix Audio Pool Samples** (the whole Set's shared pool)
- **Fix Project Samples** (this project's own files)

Both convert affected files to 44.1 kHz 16/24-bit WAV in place and repoint every sample slot that referenced them, across the whole Set.

## 10. Purge Unused Samples

The Tools tab also includes a **[Purge Unused Samples](../features/purge-unused-samples.md)** operation that finds audio files no sample slot references anywhere, then deletes them (to the Trash Bin) or moves them into a user-selected folder.

This can be done from either:
- **Purge Project Samples** from Projects Tools tab
- **Purge Audio Pool Samples** from Audio pool Tools tab (and optionally include all projects of Set)

## 11. Automatic Backups

Masta-Octa automatically backs up your project files before any write operation — whether you are enabling Edit mode, saving a Part, or executing a copy operation via Tools.

Backups are stored inside the project directory under:

```
<project>/backups/<timestamp>_<operation>/
```

For example: `backups/2026-03-26_14-30-45_copy_bank/`

This means you can always revert changes by copying the backed-up files back into the project directory.

**What gets backed up:**

| Operation | Backed-up files |
|-----------|----------------|
| Copy Banks | Destination bank file(s) (e.g., `bank01.work`) |
| Copy Parts | Destination bank file(s) |
| Copy Patterns | Destination bank file |
| Copy Tracks | Destination bank file |
| Copy Sample Slots (Copy) | Destination: `project.work`, `markers.work`, and audio files (`.wav` + `.ot`) that would be overwritten |
| Copy Sample Slots (Move to Pool) | Destination: `project.work`, `markers.work`<br/>Source: `project.work` and audio files (`.wav` + `.ot`) that will be moved/deleted |
| Fix Missing Samples | `project.work` (and sibling projects' `project.work` when using Move to Pool) |
| Purge Unused Samples (Clear unused sample slot assignments) | `project.work` - only when the option is enabled and at least one slot is cleared |
| Edit mode toggle (in header)| Current bank file |

:::tip
While automatic backups provide a safety net, it’s strongly advised to keep your own copies of your projects as well.

## Tips

- **Refresh:** If you insert a CF card, or make any change in Projects while the app is open, click the **Refresh** (↻) button in the header.
- **Version:** The header shows the installed version. This fork's automatic updater is intentionally disabled; update a source checkout manually when a reviewed version is available.
