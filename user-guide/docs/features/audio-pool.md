# Manage Audio Pool

The Audio Pool is the shared sample library for your Octatrack Set. It is located in the **`AUDIO/`** folder at the top level of your Set. All projects within that Set can make use of samples from this directory and assign them to Static or Flex Sample Slots.

Masta-Octa provides an interface for browsing, managing, importing and converting new samples to your pool.

## Browsing the Pool

Access the Audio Pool of a Set from the **Home Page** by clicking the **Audio Pool** card within any Set:

<img src={require('@site/static/img/screenshots/project-discovery-audio-pool.png').default} alt="Audio Pool interface" style={{width: '58%', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto'}} />


### Right Panel: Your Audio Pool
This shows the contents of your `AUDIO/` directory. You can:
- **Navigate:** Double-click a folder to enter it. Click the breadcrumb to go back up.
- **Create Folders:** Click **+ New Folder** to organize your library.
- **Inspect Metadata:** Every audio file shows its sample rate, bit depth, and number of channels and size.
- **Check Compatibility:** The **Compat** column shows the same face icons as the Octatrack's sample browser — a smiley for playable files, a straight face for a wrong sample rate, and **??** for audio formats the device cannot play (MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A). Non-audio files get no badge. See [Fixing Incompatible Files](#fixing-incompatible-files).
- **See Cross-Project Usage:** The **Usage** column shows, for each pool file, whether any project in the Set actually uses it — the same blue **✓ N** / gray **○ N** badges as the [Sample Slots Usage column](sample-slots.md#slot-usage). Click a badge to open a popover listing every usage, each prefixed with the project that references it (e.g. "ProjectA · Bank A · Part 1 · T1 · Machine"). The column can be sorted and filtered by Used / Referenced / Unused, just like on the Sample Slots tabs. Hover the column header for a reminder that this view spans **every project of the Set** — the [Audio Pool pane](sample-slots.md#the-audio-pool-pane) inside a project only shows that one project's own usage of a file, not the whole Set's.
- **Filter and Sort:** Use the toolbar to filter by name, bit depth, sample rate, or audio format.
- **Search recursively:** Typing in the search box matches files and folders in the current directory and all of its subfolders (a spinner shows while deep folders are scanned).

### Left Panel: Your Computer
- This is a standard file browser that lets you explore your local hard drives to find samples you want to add to your Set.

## Adding Samples (Copy / Move)

Samples can be imported to Audio Pool in several ways:

- **Drag & drop from the Browser pane:** Drag one or more files into the Audio Pool. The drop target highlights while you hover. Several files can be added at once, as well as dragging a whole folder.
- **Drag from your computer:** Drag audio files or folders directly from OS file manager into Audio Pool pane.
- **Browser item right-click:** Right-click a file and select **Copy to Pool**.
- Select an audio file from Browser pane and click the **Copy button**

## Automatic Conversion

The Octatrack hardware is very specific about the audio formats it can play. Masta-Octa converts all files added to Audio Pool automatically.

Conversion uses a **high-quality Sinc interpolation** algorithm (Blackman-Harris windowed) for the best possible audio fidelity.

### What happens during import?
- **Format:** All files (MP3, FLAC, AIFF, etc.) are converted to **WAV**.
- **Sample Rate:** Every file is resampled to **44.1 kHz** (the only rate the Octatrack supports).
- **Bit Depth:** 16-bit and 24-bit depths are preserved. Files with higher or lower bit depths are automatically adjusted to the closest supported value (16 or 24-bit).

### Progress Tracking
A progress bar appears for every file, showing the current stage of the transfer:
- **Decoding:** Reading and decoding the source file into raw audio data.
- **Resampling:** Changing the sample rate to 44.1 kHz (skipped if the source is already at 44.1 kHz).
- **Writing:** Converting to the target bit depth and creating the final file in WAV format.
- **Copying:** Simply moving the file if it is already in the correct format (no conversion needed).

## Managing Conflicts

If you try to add a file with the same name as one that already exists in your pool, a conflict dialog will appear. You can choose to:
- **Overwrite:** Replace the old file with the new one.
- **Skip:** Keep the old file and don't import the new one.
- **Apply to All:** Use your choice for all subsequent conflicts in the current batch.

## Fixing Incompatible Files

Automatic conversion covers files imported **through the app** — but a pool that was filled by hand (or by other tools) can contain MP3s, 48 kHz WAVs and other files the Octatrack silently refuses to play. The Audio Pool pane's health glyph (next to the file count) flags this at a glance, and the **Tools** tab's **Fix Audio Pool Samples** operation finds and fixes every incompatible file in the pool (and optionally every project of the Set) in one pass, with the same right-click **Convert to Octatrack format** available for a single file too.

See [Fix Incompatible Samples](fix-incompatible-samples.md) for the full walkthrough — scanning, the review screen, the row context menu, and what a fix actually does to your files.

---

## Purging Unused Samples

Pools tend to accumulate samples that no project references anymore. The **Tools** tab's **Purge Audio Pool Samples** operation finds every unused audio file in the pool — optionally across every project of the Set too — and removes it, either to the OS Trash Bin or moved into a folder of your choice.

See [Purge Unused Samples](purge-unused-samples.md) for the full walkthrough — what counts as unused, directory collapsing, and the move/delete options.

---

## Deleting Samples

To remove unwanted samples from your library:
1. Select one or more files in the right panel (Audio Pool).
2. Click **Delete**.
3. A confirmation dialog will appear to prevent accidental loss of data.

---

## Assigning Pool Samples to Slots

Audio Pool pane can be opened from a project's **Flex** or **Static** tab - where you can drag samples straight onto sample slots while in Edit mode.

See [Assigning & Managing Samples](sample-slots.md#assigning--managing-samples).

## Playback

An audio player is available the bottom of the page. Select an item from either the Browser or the Audio Pool pane to play it:
- Double-click a file to play it right away. You can also right-click it and choose **Play**.
- Use <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> to move to the previous / next slot and play it as you go.
- Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to **play / pause** the loaded sample.
- Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and press <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> to scrub backward / forward the timeline; or drag the play head to any position.
- Drag **VOL** up/down to change volume. You can also scroll over it, or hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and press <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd>.
- Click **LOOP** or use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to toggle sample repeat.
- Click **AUTO** or use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>) to toggle auto playback when selecting a file.
- Press <kbd>B</kbd> to show or hide the left (Browse) panel.

![Audio player at the bottom of the Audio Pool page](/img/screenshots/audio-pool-playback.png)

Common audio formats are supported: WAV, AIFF, FLAC, MP3, OGG/Opus, and M4A/AAC.

The player is also available from [Sample Slots](sample-slots.md#playback) within projects.

## Tips

- **Batch Processing:** You can select and transfer dozens of folders at once. Masta-Octa will handle the recursive conversion of every audio file within them.
- **External Drives:** You can browse and import samples from any connected external drive or shared network.
